## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Create a Public Issue
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately
Send a detailed report to our security team:
- **Email**: [security@synaptic.dev] (if available)
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- **Encrypted Communication**: PGP key available upon request

### 3. Include These Details
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Affected versions and configurations
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: Proposed solution (if you have one)

### 4. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## Security Best Practices

### For Template Users

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-secure-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-secure-key"
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-secure-key"

# ‚ùå NEVER: Hard-code in files
const API_KEY = "sk-1234567890"; // NEVER DO THIS
```

#### File Permissions
```bash
# Secure configuration files
chmod 600 .env
chmod 600 configs/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json

# Secure script files
chmod 755 scripts/*.sh
```

#### API Key Rotation
- Rotate API keys regularly (monthly recommended)
- Use different keys for development and production
- Monitor API key usage for anomalies
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- Follow AI personality-specific security guidelines
- Use static analysis tools (ESLint, Bandit, ShellCheck)
- Implement proper input validation
- Add security tests for new features

#### Dependency Management
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit
pip-audit

# Update dependencies regularly
npm update
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### Secure Development
- Use secure coding practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for databases

## Common Security Issues

### 1. API Key Exposure
**Risk**: High
**Prevention**:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use `.env` files with proper `.gitignore`
- Implement key validation in setup scripts
- Use environment-specific configurations

### 2. Path Traversal
**Risk**: Medium
**Prevention**:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Validate and normalize paths
const path = require('path');
const safePath = path.resolve(path.normalize(userInput));
if (!safePath.startsWith(allowedDirectory)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid path');
}
```

### 3. Command Injection
**Risk**: High
**Prevention**:
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Validate inputs in shell scripts
if [[ ! "$user_input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]]; then
  echo "Invalid input format"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 4. AI Prompt Injection
**Risk**: Medium
**Prevention**:
- Sanitize user inputs before sending to AI models
- Implement output validation
- Use structured prompts with clear boundaries
- Monitor AI responses for suspicious content

## Security Tools and Integrations

### Automated Security Scanning
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Dependency vulnerability alerts
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security issues
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency scanning
- **pip-audit**: Python dependency scanning

### Recommended Tools
- **SAST**: SonarQube, Semgrep
- **DAST**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, WhiteSource
- **Secret Scanning**: GitLeaks, TruffleHog

### Security Configuration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

```

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Breach
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate all API keys
   - Review access logs
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation**:
   - Determine scope of impact
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess data exposure
   - Review security controls

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement fixes
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for additional issues
   - Communicate with stakeholders

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct lessons learned review
   - Update security procedures
   - Improve monitoring and detection
   - Share learnings with community
