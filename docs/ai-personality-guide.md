# AI Personality Guide for Synaptic

## Understanding AI Coding Personalities

Based on comprehensive analysis of 4,442+ coding tasks across leading LLMs by Sonar, each AI model has distinct "coding personalities" with measurable characteristics. Synaptic leverages this research to provide intelligent AI orchestration and personality-aware guardrails.

## The Science Behind AI Personalities
